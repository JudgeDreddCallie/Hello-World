# Hello-World
Steve P's  code silo 
This repository contains powershell code and script programmes developed by myself for a number of projects and tasks 
that i have had the privilege of being involved in over a number of years.
As an IT consultant, systems integrator and Administrator i feel it important to be able to automate regular
Administrative tasks that require repetition
